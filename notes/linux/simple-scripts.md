## Understanding Shell Scripts

<strong> A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of shell commands that can be executed automatically. </strong>

Shell scripts are similar to Windows batch files. They can contain: commands, variables, loops, conditions, functions, arithmetic operations. Shell scripts can automate repetitive tasks.

### Executing and Debugging shell scripts

<strong> Ways to Execute a Script </strong>

1. Run Through Bash

```bash
bash myscript
```

Requirements:

- script does not need execute permission
- Bash interprets the file directly

---

2. Run as a Program

Add a shebang (#!) at the top:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
The first line of a script can specify which interpreter should run it. This tells Linux: Use Bash to execute this script.

Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x myscript
```

Run it:

```bash
./myscript
```

---

<strong> Command-Line Arguments </strong>

Anything after the script name is an argument.

Example:

```bash
./myscript file.txt
```

Here `file.txt` is a command-line argument.

---

<strong> Comments </strong>

Use `#` for comments.

```bash
echo "Hello"  # Inline comment
```

---

<strong> Debugging Techniques </strong>

1. Use `echo`

```bash
echo "Processing file..."
```

Allows you to verify program flow.

---

2. Show Executed Commands

```bash
bash -x myscript
```

or inside the script:

```bash
set -x
```

Display each command before execution.

Useful for troubleshooting.

---

<strong> Good Practices </strong>

- Write scripts in small stages
- Test frequently
- Add comments
- Keep logic simple and readable
- Use `echo` for debugging

---

### Understanding Shell Variables

<strong> Variables store data that can be reused in a shell script. </strong>

---

<strong> Creating Variables </strong>

Syntax:

```bash
$ NAME=value
$ CITY="Springfield"
```

---

<strong> Command Substitution </strong>

A variable can store the output of a command.

<i>Example: </i>

`MYDATE=$(date)` is equivalent to `MYDATE=`date`.

---

<strong> Escaping Special Characters </strong>

Some characters have special meaning in Bash:

```text
$  `  *  !
```

Use a backslash (`\`) to treat a character literally:

```bash
echo \$HOME
```

Output:

```text
$HOME
```

---
 
<strong> Quotes </strong>

| Quotes | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `' '` | Everything is treated literally |
| `" "` | Variables and commands are expanded |
| No quotes | Shell expands variables, wildcards, commands |

<i> Examples </i>

- `echo '$HOME'`: $HOME
- `echo "$HOME"`: /home/user
- `echo $HOME`: /home/user

#### Special Shell Positional Parameters

<strong> Positional parameters store command-line arguments passed to a script. </strong>

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|----------|
| `$0` | Script name (or path used to run it) |
| `$1` | First argument |
| `$2` | Second argument |
| `$3...$n` | Next arguments |
| `$#` | Number of arguments |
| `$@` | All arguments |
| `$?` | Exit status of the last command |

<i> Note: <br>
the result of `$?`: <br>
0     → success <br>
≠ 0   → error
</i>

---

#### Reading User Input

<strong> `read` Command </strong>

Used to get input from the user.

Syntax:

```bash
read variable
```

---

<strong> Prompting the User </strong>

Use `-p` to display a message:

```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " name
```

---

<strong> Reading Multiple Values </strong>

```bash
read adj1 noun1 verb1
```

Input:

```text
hairy football danced
```

Result:

```text
adj1  = hairy
noun1 = football
verb1 = danced
```

---

<strong> Example Script </strong>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Type adjective noun verb: " adj1 noun1 verb1

echo "He sighed and $verb1 to the elixir."
echo "Then he ate the $adj1 $noun1."
```

Input:

```text
hairy football danced
```

Output:

```text
He sighed and danced to the elixir.
Then he ate the hairy football.
```

#### Parameter Expansion in Bash

<strong> Parameter expansion allows you to modify or extract parts of variables. </strong>

---

Basic Syntax

These are equivalent:

```bash
$CITY
```

```bash
${CITY}
```

Curly braces are useful when the variable is next to other text:

```bash
echo "${CITY}_backup"
```

---

<strong> Default Value </strong>

- `${var:-value}`: If a variable is empty or not set, use a default value.

Example:

```bash
THIS="Example"

THIS=${THIS:-"Not Set"}
THAT=${THAT:-"Not Set"}
```

Results:

```text
THIS = Example
THAT = Not Set
```

---

<strong> Removing Text from the Beginning </strong>

- `${var#pattern}`: Remove the shortest match from the front.
- `${var##pattern}`: Remove the longest match from the front.

Example:

```bash
MYFILENAME=/home/digby/myfile.txt

FILE=${MYFILENAME##*/}
```

Result:

```text
myfile.txt
```

Explanation:

```text
##*/  → remove everything up to the last /
```

---

<strong> Removing Text from the End </strong>

- `${var%pattern}`: Remove the shortest match from the end.
- `${var%%pattern}`: Remove the longest match from the end.

Example:

```bash
DIR=${MYFILENAME%/*}
```

Result:

```text
/home/digby
```

Explanation:

```text
%/* → remove last / and everything after it
```

---

<strong> Practical Example </strong>

```bash
MYFILENAME=/home/digby/myfile.txt

FILE=${MYFILENAME##*/}
DIR=${MYFILENAME%/*}
NAME=${FILE%.*}
EXTENSION=${FILE##*.}
```

Results:

| Variable | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| MYFILENAME | /home/digby/myfile.txt |
| FILE | myfile.txt |
| DIR | /home/digby |
| NAME | myfile |
| EXTENSION | txt |

---

<strong> Most Useful Forms </strong>
 
- `${var:-value}`: Default value if variable is empty.
- `${FILE##*/}`: Get filename from path.
- `${PATH%/*}`: Get directory from path.
- `${FILE%.*}`: Get filename without extension.
- `${FILE##*.}`: Get extension.
